# Goal Tracker
Solo Project

This is a simple app I created that lets the user enter in and track their progress towards goals that they're setting out to achieve.
You are able to add goals and mark them checked off as completed. The app contains authentication too, so it can tell who's signed in and track each user's goals separately.

## This app uses:
Jest/Mocha: For TDD testing.
Express/React Router: for setting up routes.
NodeJS
